# Sign Up Page (Sakura Quest)

A simple sign-up form layout built with HTML and CSS, inspired by The Odin Project curriculum. This project focuses on structuring a form, styling inputs with pseudo-classes, and creating a visually appealing two-column layout.

## Features
- Two-column layout:
    Left sidebar with a full-height background image, dark semi-transparent overlay, and “ODIN” logo.
    Right section containing form content.
- Custom font: External font used for the logo (e.g., Norse Bold or any decorative font).
- Form structure:
    Headline and motivational text above the form.
    Input fields arranged in a two-column grid:
    * First Name
    * Last Name
    * Email
    * Phone Number
    * Password
    * Confirm Password
- Input styling: Hover effects for better user interaction.
- Footer link: Text below the form — “Already have an account? Log in”.
- Accessibility: Semantic HTML for inputs and labels.
- Image credit: Background image credited at the bottom of the sidebar (e.g., “Photo by David Clode on Unsplash”).

## Tech Stack
- HTML5 for page structure.
- CSS for layout, styling, pseudo-classes, and hover/focus effects.
- (Optional) JavaScript can be updated later for full form validation.

### Notes
- Validation: Only individual field validation is implemented using HTML5 and CSS (:invalid).
- Password matching: Not required yet — full form validation with JavaScript is covered in a later lesson.
- Responsiveness: This version is desktop-only. Responsive design will be addressed in future curriculum sections.
