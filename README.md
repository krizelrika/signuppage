# Sign Up Page (Sakura Quest)

A simple sign-up form layout built with HTML and CSS, inspired by The Odin Project curriculum. This project focuses on structuring a form, styling inputs with pseudo-classes, and creating a visually appealing two-column layout.

## Features
- Two-column layout:
    Left sidebar with a full-height background image, dark semi-transparent overlay, and “ODIN” logo.
    Right section containing form content.
- Custom font: External font used for the logo (e.g., Norse Bold or any decorative font).
- Form structure:
    Headline and motivational text above the form.
    Input fields arranged in a two-column grid:
        * First Name

Last Name

Email

Phone Number

Password

Confirm Password

Input styling:

Default light border (#E5E7EB).

Focus state: blue border with subtle box-shadow.

Invalid state: red border on password inputs if invalid (:invalid pseudo-class).

Button:

“Start Your Adventure” button styled in #596D48, matching tones from the sidebar background image.

Hover effects for better user interaction.

Footer link: Text below the form — “Already have an account? Log in”.

Accessibility: Semantic HTML for inputs and labels.

Image credit: Background image credited at the bottom of the sidebar (e.g., “Photo by Halie West on Unsplash”).

Notes

Validation: Only individual field validation is implemented using HTML5 and CSS (:invalid).

Password matching: Not required yet — full form validation with JavaScript is covered in a later lesson.

Responsiveness: This version is desktop-only. Responsive design will be addressed in future curriculum sections.

Tech Stack
HTML5 for page structure.

CSS3 for layout, styling, pseudo-classes, and hover/focus effects.

(Optional) JavaScript can be added later for full form validation.
